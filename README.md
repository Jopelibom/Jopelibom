## Hello, the name is Jope :bust_in_silhouette:

  I like to make things and watch them burn, things I should post here, but I always forget and when I remember I've already lost the files :skull:.

## Languages

  I don't have a specialized language, but I can get by with **Python, C++, HTML, Ruby and Lua**. I'm not a professional and I'm far from being one but I like to try.
  
## Experiences
  I don't have any professional experience but I intend to start some personal projects and I'll try to post them here (if I remember).
